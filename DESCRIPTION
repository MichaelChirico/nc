Title: Named Capture
Description: User-friendly functions for extracting a data
 table (row for each match, column for each group)
 from non-tabular text data using regular expressions.
 Patterns are defined using a readable syntax
 that makes it easy to build complex patterns
 in terms of simpler, re-usable sub-patterns.
 Named R arguments are translated to column names
 in the output; internally un-named capture groups
 are used in order to provide a standard interface
 to three regex C libraries (PCRE, RE2, ICU).
 Output also includes row names based on subject
 names or the name group, and numeric columns via
 user-specified type conversion functions.
Depends: R (>= 2.14)
Suggests: testthat, data.table, re2r, knitr,
