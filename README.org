User-friendly functions for extracting data tables from non-tabular
text using regular expressions.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  food.vec <- c("granny smith apple", "blood orange")
  nc::capture_first_vec(food.vec, type=".*", " ", fruit="orange|apple")
  #>            type  fruit
  #> 1: granny smith  apple
  #> 2:        blood orange
#+END_SRC

** Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC R
install.packages("nc")
## or:
if(!require(devtools))install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tdhock/nc")
#+END_SRC


** Usage overview

The main functions provided in nc are:

| Subject              | First match                   | All matches       |
|----------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------|
| Single string        | NA                            | =capture_all_str= |
| Character vector     | =capture_first_vec=           | NA                |
| Data frame chr cols  | =capture_first_df=            | NA                |
| Data frame col names | =capture_first_melt=          | NA                |
| Data frame col names | =capture_first_melt_multiple= | NA                |

- [[https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/nc/vignettes/v1-capture-first.html][Vignette 1]] discusses =capture_first_vec= and =capture_first_df=, and
  =capture_first_melt=, which capture the first match in each of
  several subjects (character vector, data frame character columns).
- [[https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/nc/vignettes/v2-capture-all.html][Vignette 2]] discusses =capture_all_str= which captures all matches in
  a single big multi-line subject string. The vignette also shows how
  to use =capture_all_str= on several different multi-line subject
  strings, using data.table =by= syntax.
- [[https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/nc/vignettes/v3-capture-first-melt.html][Vignette 3]] discusses =capture_first_melt= and
  =capture_first_melt_multiple= which match a regex to the column
  names of a wide data frame, then melt the matching columns. These
  functions are especially useful when more than one separate piece of
  information can be captured from each column name, e.g. the iris
  column names =Petal.Width=, =Sepal.Width=, etc each have two pieces
  of information (flower part and measurement dimension).

** Choice of regex engine

By default, nc uses PCRE. Other options include ICU and RE2.

To tell nc that you would like to use a certain engine, 
#+BEGIN_SRC R
options(nc.engine="RE2")
#+END_SRC

Every function also has an engine argument, e.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  nc::capture_first_vec(
    "foo a\U0001F60E# bar",
    before=".*?",
    emoji="\\p{EMOJI_Presentation}",
    after=".*",
    engine="ICU")
  #>   before emoji after
  #> 1  foo a     ðŸ˜Ž # bar
#+END_SRC

** Related work

Going forward I recommend using nc rather than [[https://github.com/tdhock/namedCapture][namedCapture]],
which is an older package that provides 
[[https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/namedCapture/vignettes/v2-recommended-syntax.html][a similar API]]:

| namedCapture           | nc                 |
|------------------------+--------------------|
| str_match_variable     | capture_first_vec  |
| str_match_all_variable | capture_all_str    |
| df_match_variable      | capture_first_df   |
| NA                     | capture_first_melt |
| NA                     | field              |

There are a few differences between nc and namedCapture:
- nc functions all have the =capture_= prefix for easy auto-completion.
- Internally =nc= uses un-named capture groups, whereas =namedCapture=
  uses named capture groups. This allows =nc= to support the ICU
  engine in addition to PCRE and RE2.
- Output in =nc= is always a data.table (=namedCapture= functions
  output either a character matrix or a data.frame).
- =nc::capture_first_df= does not prefix subject column names to
  capture group column names, whereas
  =namedCapture::df_match_variable= does.
- By default the =nc::capture_first_vec= stops with an error if any
  subjects do not match, whereas =namedCapture::str_match_variable=
  returns NA/missing rows.
- Subject names and the capture group named =name= are not treated
  specially (in =namedCapture= they are used for rownames of output).
- =nc::capture_first_melt= inputs a data.frame, tries to match a regex
  to its column names, then uses matching column names as measure.vars
  in melt (similar to =tidyr::pivot_longer= but no equivalent in
  =namedCapture=).
- Helper function =nc::field= is provided for defining patterns (with
  no repetition) that match subjects like variable=value, and create a
  column/group named variable.

detailed comparison with other R regex packages.
